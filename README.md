# JavaScript Practice Lesson

You’ll be working on three mini-projects that will help you level up your skills in **loops, DOM manipulation, onclick, and if statements**.

## What We’re Doing Today

### 1. Click Counter Challenge

**What You’ll Learn:**

- How to use button onclick
- How to update elements in the DOM (`document.getElementById`)
- How to use `if` statements to make decisions

**What You’ll Build:**  
You’ll create a button that keeps track of how many times it’s clicked. When it reaches 10, a message pops up. Super simple, but really useful!

### 2. Counting with Loops 

**What You’ll Learn:**

- How `for` loops work in JavaScript
- How to dynamically change content on a webpage (`innerHTML`)

**What You’ll Build:**  
A button that, when clicked, fills a list (`<ul>`) with numbers from 1 to 10. No more manually typing them out—let JavaScript do the work for you!

### 3. Color Changer 

**What You’ll Learn:**

- How to use arrays to store multiple values
- How to loop through an array with a `for` loop
- How to change an element’s style dynamically (`style.backgroundColor`)
- How to trigger changes with onclick

**What You’ll Build:**  
A color-changing box! Every time you click a button, the box will change to a new color from a predefined list. Once you reach the last color, it loops back to the beginning. Super cool, right?

## How to Make the Most of This Lesson

1. **Read the instructions carefully** before tweaking the code.
2. **Experiment!** Try changing things up—add more colors, extend the loop, or tweak the conditions.
3. **Predict the outcome** before running the code to sharpen your problem-solving skills.
