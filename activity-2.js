// Activity 2: Counting with Loops (15 min)
// Goal: Use a for loop to generate a list of numbers dynamically in the DOM.

//Instructions
  // 1. Add a <button> with generateList() as an onclick to activity-2.html.
  // 2. Add an empty <ul> with an id "numberList" to activity-2.html, this is where the numbers will appear.
  // 3. Write a function called, "generateList" , that:
    // Uses a for loop to count from 1 to 10.
    // Creates a new <li> for each number.
    // Adds each <li> to the <ul>.
